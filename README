This directory contains the version 0.99-alpha release of libRadtran.

LibRadtran is under rapid development and new version releases will
be coming soon.

As of this release, libRadtran is known to run on the following
configurations: 

                dec-alpha               using f2c and gcc
                hpux                    using f2c and gcc
		linux                   using g77/f2c and gcc
		Windows 98/NT           using g77 and gcc

It should run on any system using g77/f2c and gcc. 

See the file INSTALL to find out how to configure, build, install, and
port libRadtran.  

LibRadtran is completely documented by the texinfo manual
found in the `doc/' subdirectory.  The manual is under writing and
contains some known errors and omissions; we regret that we do not
have the resources to work on the manual as much as we would like.   

Sample programs including the much used uvspec program are found in
the `tools' directory.
