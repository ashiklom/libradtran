The spectrum_UV* files were used to simulate the measured spectrum in Fig.8.
To run the input file from the command line issue the following command:

       uvspec < spectrum_UV.inp > your_output_file

The included spectrum_UV.OUT is a sample output files calculated by
Arve Kylling on an iMac 20100201.
