The examples in this directory are those that are included in the GUI
at startup time. The GUI will automagically list all examples that
have the following files present in this directory:

   example_name.INP
   example_name_thumb.jpg   
   example_name_prev.jpg   

For many examples a example_name_plot.py is also included. This python
script was used to create the thumb and prev plots.

The thumb and prev plots are most easily made by first saving the plot
in some format (for example png). Executing the command
   
   python make_example.py example_name.png

will create the correct-sized thumb and prev jpg-files.
