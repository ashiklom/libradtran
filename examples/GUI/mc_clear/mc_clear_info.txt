Title: Polarisation with  MYSTIC 
This example calculates the normalised reflectance for the I,Q and U
components of the Stokes vector using the MYSTIC solver. The figure
includes calculations from both a Rayleigh only atmosphere (blue
curves) and an aerosol loaded atmosphere (red curves). The input file
in this example does not contain aerosol information. To include
aerosols the OPAC mie files must be installed and the following input
parameters set: 

aerosol_default          # switch on aerosol

                         # specify aerosol mixture file
aerosol_species_file     continental_average

You may also want to change mc_basename.

Please note that the GUI is not yet capable of plotting allt the
output produced by MYSTIC. That includes the output from this example.
