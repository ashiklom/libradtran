HOWTO build an executable
=========================
The procedure of building the GUI to an executable will probably only
be done by developers. It is important to note that the executable
will be very big(about 20-30mb), and not faster than running the
GUI.py file. 

To build executables of the GUI for the various platforms modules like
py2app, cxFreeze and py2exe have to be used. One of these modules have
to be installed, depending on your platform. Ideally, you only have to
type python "<type>_setup.py" in the GUI directory to create an
executable for your platform. However not all of the setups have been
tested, so you might have to tinker around a bit to get i right. 


HOWTO regenerate documentation for the GUI
==========================================
1) cd GUI/resources

2) python make_html_doc.py

3) tar -czvf html_doc.tar.gz html_doc

For step 2) the following is required

 i)  in your PYTHONPATH you must have libRadtran-version_number/GUI
 ii) you must have latexml installed.

None of 1-3 is automated in any Makefiles
Note that:
* You may need to set your environment variable 
  PYTHONPATH (bash: PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:../:../../python)
* latexml must be installed (linux: sudo apt-get install latexml)
