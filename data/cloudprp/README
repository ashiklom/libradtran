Mie calculations to be used with uvspec "wc_properties <filename>"

Required: Frank Evans' cloudprp (part of SHDOM)
 Slightly modified source code in ./cloudprp 
 (increased number of moments); call 'make' to generate

(1) Adjust # of effective radii (n_reff), effective 
 radius range (reff_min, reff_max), and phase (water/ice)
 in makeinp.awk 

(2) Generate input with makeinp.sh; makeinp.sh expects three-column 
 files in ./input/ which define the wavelength bands for which the Mie
 calculations are to be made. The extension has to be .wvl and the  
 three columns are:
  (i)   center wavelength (ignored)
  (ii)  start wavelength  [micron]
  (iii) end wavelength    [micron]
 makeinp.sh generates input files (*.inp) and shell scripts (*.sh) to
 automatize the Mie calculations. 

(3) Finally, call the master shell script doall.sh created by
 makeinp.sh; output is provided in ASCII (*.mie) and netcdf (*.cdf) format
